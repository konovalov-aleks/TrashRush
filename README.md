# TrashRush
simple sorter game for Android

_Google sent me an email informing me that my dev-account had been inactive for a year and would soon be deleted. They told me I needed to release something to prevent deletion. "Okay, Google... you want activity? Get it," I thought, and wrote this little game over the course of a couple of evenings._

_P.S.: it turned out that Google tightened the screws in 2024, requiring at least 12 testers to test for 14 days in case of a game... that's not an option. So, I'll have to write something other than a game... to be continued_
